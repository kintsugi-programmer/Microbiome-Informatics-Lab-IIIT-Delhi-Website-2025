# Microbiome-Informatics-Lab-IIIT-Delhi-Website-2025
We are developing the official website for the Microbiome Informatics Lab at IIIT Delhi as a digital extension of the FMT Hub. The platform is being built using Next.js 15, React 19, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, focusing on modular UI, SEO, and responsiveness. Weâ€™re implementing secure APIs, dynamic routing, and scalable backend architecture for seamless performance. Deployment is handled on Oracle Linux with Apache, using SSL-secured HTTPS. This site will serve as a centralized digital gateway for lab research, data resources, and collaborations.

## Introduction
We are currently building the official website for the Microbiome Informatics Lab at IIIT Delhi, as a natural extension of our previous work on the FMT Hub. This project aims to establish a unified and professional digital presence for the lab, integrating research insights, personnel, publications, and data tools into a modern, performant web platform.
The development stack includes Next.js 15, React 19, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, with a focus on modular UI design, SEO optimization, and cross-device responsiveness. We're engineering dynamic routing, secure API endpoints, and scalable backend architecture to ensure smooth frontend-backend communication and future-proof extensibility. The deployment is being handled on Oracle Linux servers with Apache, using SSL-secured custom HTTPS for encrypted connections.
In this phase, we are focusing on:
- Creating reusable component libraries for consistent lab branding.
- Building user-centric interfaces that highlight lab research, team profiles, and live updates.
- Integrating the FMT Hub data layer for seamless navigation between resources.
- Ensuring performance and accessibility compliance through Lighthouse audits and testing.

This project will serve as a centralized hub for collaborators, researchers, and external stakeholders, significantly elevating the visibility and digital maturity of the Microbiome Informatics Lab.
