# Microbiome-Informatics-Lab-IIIT-Delhi-Website-2025
We are developing the official website for the Microbiome Informatics Lab at IIIT Delhi as a digital extension of the FMT Hub. The platform is being built using Next.js 15, React 19, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, focusing on modular UI, SEO, and responsiveness. Weâ€™re implementing secure APIs, dynamic routing, and scalable backend architecture for seamless performance. Deployment is handled on Oracle Linux with Apache, using SSL-secured HTTPS. This site will serve as a centralized digital gateway for lab research, data resources, and collaborations.
